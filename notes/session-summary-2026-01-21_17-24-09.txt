Session Summary (2026-01-21 17:24:09)

Work completed
- Built and iterated a Next.js (TypeScript) site in /site with pages: /, /history, /metrics.
- Data pipeline: scripts/csv_to_json.py converts CSV to predictions_YYYY-MM-DD.json; scripts/publish_daily.sh writes to both site/public/data and predictions/json and defaults to newest CSV in predictions/csv.
- Table: sortable, searchable, centered columns; numeric formatting with plus signs for positive spreads; absolute point edge display; “No Data” for missing book spread.
- Filters: search + numeric inputs for Prob Edge Min and Point Edge Min with AND/OR toggle between them.
- UI styling: Times New Roman, pro broadcast palette, stronger header typography, active nav underline, single white panel combining controls + table, and tuned background pattern.
- Git: initialized repo, added .gitignore (including *.pem and log_output.txt), committed, and pushed to GitHub.
- Vercel: created and deployed project hoops-edge; added site/vercel.json for Next.js detection; verified auto‑deploy from GitHub; URLs:
  - https://hoops-edge.vercel.app
  - https://hoops-edge-git-main-dnursey23.vercel.app

Key files
- site/pages/index.tsx, site/pages/history.tsx, site/pages/metrics.tsx
- site/lib/data.ts, site/lib/server-data.ts
- site/styles/globals.css
- scripts/csv_to_json.py, scripts/publish_daily.sh
- site/vercel.json

Notes
- CSV date inference supports YYYY-M-D in filename and date column; output JSON includes date, generated_at, games[] and game_id.
- GitHub integration was reconnected; new pushes to main should trigger Vercel deploys.

Next steps (if needed)
- Keep publishing via: bash scripts/publish_daily.sh /path/to/preds.csv
- Commit and push new data files under site/public/data to update the live site.

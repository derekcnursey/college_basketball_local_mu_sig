Session Summary (2026-01-21 18:49:47)

Work completed
- Generated final score JSONs per prediction date from bart_data/2026_super_sked.csv using a new script.
- Added final score data to the History table and removed today from the date picker; removed the History hero block.
- Updated Metrics page to compute MAE, MSE, mean error, and ATS win % using final_scores and predictions.
- ATS win % now uses pick_side when available; model_mu_home sign adjusted (negative = home favored).
- Metrics UI simplified (lifetime header added, table reduced to the four metrics + game count, dates sorted desc).
- Fixed final score parsing to use boxscore data to avoid reversed scores.
- Centered and tightened metric card spacing.
- Committed and pushed all changes to main.
